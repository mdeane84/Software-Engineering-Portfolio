#2D Game Engine

This is a game engine built using only default Java libraries. It has interconnected item, entity, crafting, and inventory
systems. I wrote all the Java code for this project, but the art assets were supplied courtesy of my friend, Jack. You can
view the source code in the 'src' file tree, or run it using the 'launcher.jar' executable java archive file.
