# Software-Engineering-Portfolio

Iâ€™m a junior at Oregon State University and will graduate with a BS: CS in computer systems June 2021. Classes I plan to complete before the summer are Software Engineering (CS 361/362), Databases (CS 340), Analysis of Algorithms (CS 325), Operating Systems (CS 344), and more.

## overview of projects

Here are some descriptions of the projects currently in the repository. More information on projects can be found in the README corresponding to each project.

### Java Projects

I've spent most of my time writing Java so it is what I am most comfortable with. Most of my projects will be in this section.

* 2D Game Engine

This is by far the largest project I have worked on. It is a Java game engine written using only default Java libraries. The art assets were provided courtesy of a friend, but the code was written by me.

### Python Projects

Although I have less experience in Python than I do in Java, I feel more than capable writing competent Python scripts.

* Twitch.tv Chat-Bot

This is a chatbot that uses sockets to communicate with the twitch.tv servers to interact with messages in chat. The bot can respond to messages with either a pre-written response or with the result of a function that takes parameters from the message.
